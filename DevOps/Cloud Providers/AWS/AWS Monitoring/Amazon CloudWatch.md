### What is CloudWatch? 

CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data ion the form of logs, metrics and events, and visualizes it using automated dashboards so you get can get a unified view of your AWS resources, applications and services that run in AWS.

CloudWatch home page automatically displays metrics about every AWS service you use. You can additionally create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom applications, and display custom collections of metrics you choose.

You can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring when a threshold is breached. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances and then use that data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load.
