#### What is a region?

Amazon cloud computing resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide. These locations are composed of AWS Regions, [[Availability Zones]], and [[Local Zones]]. Each _AWS Region_ is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as _Availability Zones_.

Each AWS Region is designed to be isolated from the other AWS Regions. This design achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.

Examples of AWS regions would be eu-west-2 or us-east-1
