Andon cord pulls - In order to prevent cases of people starting the day with work being in a state of 'almost done' try experimenting with an Andon cord. (1) when someone "pulls" the cord, everyone stops what they are doing to work towards a path to a solution. (2) "Pull" the cord whenever you need the option of the team or are stuck with something. This will help boost cycle time of work. Side note: you may need to experiment with ways of incentivizing the cord to be pulled. 

Also try experimenting with different types of Andon cord
