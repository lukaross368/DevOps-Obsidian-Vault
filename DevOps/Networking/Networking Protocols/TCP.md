Transmission Control Protocol.

When the communication between two computers needs to be reliable TCP is the best option to guarantee that the data is received correctly. 

Connection oriented protocol , meaning that it must establish a session before any communication can take place. This is done with a 3-way handshake. 
First the sender sends a SYN. Then the receiving computer sends back a SYN ACK to say that it has acknowledged message. Finally the sending computer sends a ACK RECEIVED. Once this has taken place data can be transferred.

TCP guarantees the delivery of all data packets.

TCP is a Transport Layer protocol in the [[OSI model]].
