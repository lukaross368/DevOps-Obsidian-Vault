The Internet Protocol (IP) is the network layer communications protocol in the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the [[IP addresses]] in the Packet headers. 

The first major version of IP, [[IPV4]], is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is [[IPV6]], which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since c. 2006.
