Secure Sockets Layer

SSL is a protocol that's used to ensure secure connections on the internet. 

Uses [[Public Key Encryption]] to secure data.

Clients connecting to servers with SSL will ask the server for their SSL certificate. SSL certificates are used to authenticate the identify of a website. The Client will check this certificate to make sure its trustworthy. If it is, the protocol continues and the client will attempt to connect to the server.
