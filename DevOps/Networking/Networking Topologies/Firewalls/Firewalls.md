A Firewall is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorised access from entering a private network.

By filtering the information that comes in from the internet, a firewall blocks unwanted traffic and permits  wanted traffic. 

The general purpose is to create a safety barrier between a private network and the public internet.

Firewalls refer to a Access Control List (ACL) which is a table containing rules for the types of traffic which are allowed and on which ports and with witch protocols etc.

Firewall rules can be based on:

- IP addresses
- Domain Names
- Protocols
- Programs
- Ports
- Keywords

We can also get Host-based Firewalls. These are firewalls installed on computers or on a specific host and protect that host only. 

Another type is a Network firewall. This is a combination of hardware and software and sits between the private network and public internet. A network firewall protects the whole network.
