Local Area Network

- Private network 
- Examples: Network inside of a building i.e. home, or some kind of organisation 

Fundamentally, a LAN is made up of network devices and [[Switches]].  In this case the computers can only communicate with other computers on the LAN.  However, if the computers or devices in this network want to communicate with another network (for example the Internet) they would need to contact an Internet Service Provider (ISP) which will then send them a gateway (combination of a [[Modem]] & [Router](Routers) ). Now the Computers in this LAN can connect to, and be a part of, a [[WAN]]
(Wide Area Network).
