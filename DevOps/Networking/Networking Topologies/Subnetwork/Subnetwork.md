A Subnetwork, or Subnet, is when a [[LAN]] or [[WAN]] is partitioned into smaller networks.

Why do we want to Split our network into Subnets?

- Improve performance
- Security 
- Manageability 

Subnets separate networks physically compared to [[VLANs]] which separate networks virtually

Subnets are created by using [[Routers]]

In terms of [[IP addresses]] , Subnetting is done by changing the default [[Subnet Mask]] in a network by borrowing some of the bits from the host portion.

For example, if we take the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 -->
