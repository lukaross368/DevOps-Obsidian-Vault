Routers route data from one network to another based on their [[IP addresses]].

When a data packet is received from the router, the router inspects the data's IP address and determines if the packet is meant for its own network or another network. If the router determines that data packet is meant for its own network , it receives it. If not , then it sends it to another network. 

A router is essentially the gateway of a network.

Routers can route traffic statically or dynamically (see [[Dynamic routing]]), also see [[NAT]].
