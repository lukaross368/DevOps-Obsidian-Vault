Dynamic routing uses some routing protocols. Unlike Static routing which uses no protocols and just routed in the network based on some manually entered rules in the routing table. 

A big drawback with static routing is that it requires 24/7 support (in the case of a router in your network failing ,  the other routers can not decide alternative routes for the data)

Dynamic routing uses routing protocols for creating a route for data packets.

The router automatically collects and stores routes in the routing table.
