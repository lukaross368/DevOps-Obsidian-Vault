A device with multiple ports that accepts Ethernet connection from network devices.

A switch is 'intelligent'

A switch learns the physical [[MAC Addresses]] of network devices and stores them in a switch table so when a data packet is sent through a switch it is only directed to the intended port.

Hubs and Switches are used to exchange data in a Local Area Network (see: [[LAN]]), they are not used to exchange data outside their network (for example to the internet). To exchange data from your local network or subnetwork (see: [[Subnetwork]]) you would need a [router](Routers.md) .
