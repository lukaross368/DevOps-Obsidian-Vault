Networking is connecting computer systems
Networking is the plumbing that enables systems to talk to each other

A network of computers is a group or set of computers that share data between nodes. They do this by making use of communication protocols. 

These nodes are identified by network address and sometimes hostnames. Hostnames give nodes a more human-readable way to be identified.
